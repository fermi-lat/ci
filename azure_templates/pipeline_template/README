To deploy in a Fermi-lat organization repository, take the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the azure-pipelines.yml file found in the same directory as this README into the repository's top level directory
3. Open the copied azure-pipelines.yml file and set the 'value' key in the 'variables' section to the name of the repository you are setting the pipeline up for.
4. Add the file to the git repository and push the change to github
5. Navigate to FermiSpaceTelescope/Fermitools/Pipelines in Azure DevOps and click 'New Pipeline'
6. Select GitHub as the location of the code
7. Select the repository you wish to create a pipeline for.  Note: You may have to set the drop down menu to 'All Repositories' as opposed to 'My repositories'
8. Azure should detect the already existing pipeline configuration file.  Review the file then click 'Save and Run'
